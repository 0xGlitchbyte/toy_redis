# Build Your Own Redis

This project is an educational implementation of Redis, a popular in-memory data structure store. It is part of a series of tutorials aimed at helping developers understand the internals of Redis by building a simplified version from scratch.
Project Overview

This repository contains the code to create a minimal, custom Redis server, built from the ground up. By following the tutorial series on build-your-own.org, we will implement Redis' core features and functionality in a series of steps.

Each step of the tutorial is designed to introduce new concepts and tools in systems programming, networking, and data storage, with a focus on how Redis operates under the hood.
Goals of the Project

    Learn how Redis works at the implementation level.

    Implement essential features such as handling client connections, commands, and data persistence.

    Build a simple in-memory database that supports data structures like strings, lists, and sets.

    Gain a deeper understanding of networking, concurrency, and memory management.
